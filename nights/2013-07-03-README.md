## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ Prominent bad column in all images (may be fixable since it is present in the bias frames, so it should subtract out).
+ `SA112-SF1-007R1.fit` -- nice satellite track in here.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

I had to add SA112 to the Feder object list and re-run patching/triage...and then manually add the object name SA112.
