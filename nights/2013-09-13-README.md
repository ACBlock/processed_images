## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `calib-003bias.fit` and `calib-010bias.fit` -- both have a few bright spots
+ `calib-002D10.fit`, `calib-008D10.fit`, & `kelt-1-b-001D45.fit` through `kelt-1-b-015D60.fit` -- all had bright spots. [MWC: bright spots in the kelt images are stars]
+ All of the darks named `calib-008D*.fit` are wavy (light leak).
+ Most of the light images looked the same. However, a few of them had little specks.

Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing needed.
