Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `Calibration-006Bias.fit` -- darker then then rest
+ `Calibration-003Dark60.fit` -- bright spot on the left
+ `Calibration-010Bias.fit` -- much darker then the rest
+ `kelt-1-036R.fit` -- Long satellite/plane track
+ `kelt-1-038R.fit` -- short satellite/plane track

+ `LoveJoy-010R` -- short satellite/plane track


## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

+ None of the science images are showing WCS info in astroimageJ.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?
