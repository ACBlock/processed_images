## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `flood-flat-009Bias.fit` -- only bias image that looks like exposure is higher or is dark image
+ `ey-uma-001R.fit` --  looks like a light image
+ `ey-uma-002R.fit` -- looks like light image
+ `ey-uma-038R.fit` -- something bright passed by
+ `ey-uma-049R.fit` -- something bright passed by
+ Some darks are wavy.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)


## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Two images had to be re-classified as `LIGHT`, then re-ran astrometry, patching and triage.

Used these two scripts to do it:

`01-change-imagetyp.sh` and `02-add-astrometry-and-repatch.sh`
