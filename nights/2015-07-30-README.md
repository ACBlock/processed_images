## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `calibration-004bias.fit` -- This bias has horizontal bands in it.
+ ALL OF THE DARKS ARE "WAVY" because of a light leak.
+ The B and V band flats seem to have a bright line at the top and left edges.
+ `kelt-1-004R.fit` -- nice satellite track.
+ The images of SA113 up to and including the ones numbered `019` have clear cloud or haze (sky background is very bright). A good example is `sa113-002I.fit`.
+ `sa113-020R.fit` -- partial satellit track.

Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Not much, just manually added the object name SA113 to a few images.
