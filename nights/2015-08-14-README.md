## Unusual images?

None

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

I first had to update [msumastro](https://github.com/mwcraig/msumastro) to include the version of MaxIm DL used that night and re-run patching. Then I had to manually add SA113 as the object to a few of the images.

The scripts involved were named:

```
01-rerun-patch-traige-after-object-update.sh
02-add-object-name-manually.sh
```
