## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ Some of the darks seem to have more hot pixels than usual.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

The changes I made are in this script, which is in the directory with the images: `01-rerun-patch-traige-after-object-update.sh`

I had to add WASP 52 to the list of objects Feder knows about and then re-run header patching and triage.
