## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `calibration-014R.fit` -- image of stars, not actually of calibration. Probably this image was used to initialize the telescope pointing.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [ ] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

+ `calibration-014R.fit` -- no significant object in the image.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

To generate the astrometry for two of the images, `Tres-3b-002B.fit` and `Tres-3b-003B.fit` I had to run astrometry on my laptop, then upload the fixed images to the `staged` directory on `esne-bide`. Once there, I re-ran patching and triage with this script: `01-rerun-patch-traige-after-redone-astrometry.sh`
