## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual?

No unusual images, but the images taken later in the night have a much brighter sky background, so it was likely getting hazy.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

These images of M71 are missing WCS information:

+ `M71-017B.fit` -- no WCS, much brighter background than other B images of this cluster.
+ `M71-018B.fit` -- no WCS, much brighter background than other B images of this cluster.
+ `M71-019B.fit` -- no WCS, much brighter background than other B images of this cluster.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

The scripts that did the fixing are in the directory with the data. In a nutshell, I:

+ Manually added RA/Dec information to some M15 and M71 images for which the blind astrometry failed initially.
+ Re-ran astrometry, pathcing and triage.
