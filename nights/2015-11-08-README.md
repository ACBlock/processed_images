## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)


## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

The two darks taken with lights on were moved into a subdirectory to prevent them from being used accidentally.
