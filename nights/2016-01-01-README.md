## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `ey-uma-008R.fit ` -- EY UMa not actually in the field of view of this image.
+ There are satellite trails in:
  + `ey-uma-026R.fit`
  + `ey-uma-069R.fit`
  + `ey-uma-070R.fit`
  + `ey-uma-093R.fit`
  + `ey-uma-094R.fit`
+ From `hat-p-54-021R.fit` through `hat-p-54-214R.fit` -- bright streak in upper right part of image from bright star just off-frame.
+ `hat-p-54-094R.fit` -- Horizontal dark band near top of image.
+ `hat-p-54-166R.fit` -- Big cosmic ray or short satellite track.


## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

I had to re-run astrometry (and then re-run triage) because astrometry.net had been updated but the link to the index files was missing. No problems once that was fixed.
