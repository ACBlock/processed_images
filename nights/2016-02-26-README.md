## Raw image gallery: ['http://physics.mnstate.edu/feder_gallery//2016-02-26']

## Unusual images?

No "unusual" images although the flats look pretty uneven with a lot of dust rings.  I haven't been out to the observatory recently to compare it with other nights.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [X] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)


## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Remember, you should do your changes with scripts that you number and place in the
directory along with the data so the procedure could be repeated if needed or
desired.

Here, explain in English (not code) what you fixed, if anything.

Had to rerun astrometry on two images after adding pointing information to one of them.
