## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `calibration-flood-003D90.fit` -- Bright spot near the center of the image
+ `ey-uma-001R.fit-tres-3-013R.fit` -- Light images in the flat image place
+ `ey-uma-004R.fit ` -- Satellite trail though image


## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Had to reclassify several of the images as `LIGHT`, then re-run astrometry and patching.
