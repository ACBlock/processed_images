## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ Note that several calibration images for this night **are not intended to be used for calibration**. They were taken to characterize the camera...so if you use this night be careful to exclude them when doing your reduction.
+ `IC4665(Quad3)-002V.fit` -- nice satellite or plane track in here.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)
- [x] EXAMPLE checked-off box, please delete.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

I had to add the object name to the cluster images manually because the center of the cluster is pretty far from the center of the images (because the cluster is so large).
